  question: Why is it important to avoid copying the values of props into a component's
    state where possible?
  answers:
  - because you should never mutate state
  - because getDerivedStateFromProps() is an unsafe method to use
  - because you want to allow a component to update in response to changes in the
    props
  - because you want to allow data to flow back up to the parent
